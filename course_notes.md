# Modern Web Development with Perl

Thanks for signing up to my workshop on web development with Perl.

In three and a half hours, I hope to persuade you that Modern Perl
bears no relation to the language that you stopped using to write
horrible CGI programs fifteen years ago and that it is well worth
taking a look at when you are deciding which web technology to use.

We'll do that by writing a simple web application using modern Perl
tools. Obviously in three hours we won't be able to create the next
social media sensation, but we should have time to touch on many
useful parts of the modern Perl web development toolkit.

In order to do that, you'll need to bring some equipment. Here's a list:

* A laptop. It would be great if you could have a Unix-like operating
system installed (Linux or OSX). The examples **should** all work on
Windows, but I can't guarantee it. If you have a Windows laptop, then
a good workaround is to install something like VirtualBox and set-up
a Linux VM.

On your laptop. you'll need a version of Perl. One advantage of the
Unix-like operating systems, is that they will almost certainly come
with Perl installed. If you're running the examples on Windows, then
I recommend Strawberry Perl.

Your version of Perl should be as recent as possible. The most recent
version is currently is 5.22.1, but anything from 5.10 onwards should
work. If you want to install a more recent version of Perl than you
get with your OS, I recommend `perlbrew`.
